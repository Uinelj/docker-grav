Grav is a Fast, Simple, and Flexible file-based Web-platform. There is Zero installation required. Although Grav follows principles similar to other flat-file CMS platforms, it has a different design philosophy than most.

The underlying architecture of Grav is built using well established and best-in-class technologies. This is to ensure that Grav is simple to use and easy to extend. Some of these key technologies include:

* Twig Templating: for powerful control of the user interface
* Markdown: for easy content creation
* YAML: for simple configuration
* Parsedown: for fast Markdown and Markdown Extra support
* Doctrine Cache: for performance
* Pimple Dependency Injection Container: for extensibility and maintainability
* Symfony Event Dispatcher: for plugin event handling
* Symfony Console: for CLI interface
* Gregwar Image Library: for dynamic image manipulation
